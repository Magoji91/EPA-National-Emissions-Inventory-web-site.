Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

I-) Nonpoint (green line):PM2.5 500t reduction between 1999 and 2008.

II-) Point (purple line): There was a vertiginous increase in the emission of pollutants between 1999 and 2005, but from 2005 to 2008 it is observed that the emission of PM2.5 remained below 450t..

III-) Onroad (blue line): The PM2.5 emission has remained below the other rates from 1999 to 2007 and was still in a slight downward trend in 2008

IV-) Nonroad (red line): It is similar to the on-road chart, but it shows a sharper drop in pollutant emissions in the years 1999 to 2002 and a steeper decline between 2005 and 2008.
