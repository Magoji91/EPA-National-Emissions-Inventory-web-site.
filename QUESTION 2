Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? 
Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

R - 


Baltimore <- NEI[NEI$fips == "24510", ]
totalPM25ByYear <- tapply(Baltimore$Emissions, Baltimore$year, sum)
plot(totalPM25ByYear, x = rownames(totalPM25ByYear), type = "n", axes = FALSE, 
+      ylab = expression("Total PM"[2.5] * " Emission (in tons)"), xlab = "Year", 
+      main = expression("Total PM"[2.5] * " Emission in Baltimore (1999 - 2008)"))
points(totalPM25ByYear, x = rownames(totalPM25ByYear), pch = 16, col = "purple")
lines(totalPM25ByYear, x = rownames(totalPM25ByYear), col = "blue")
axis(2)
axis(side = 1, at = seq(1999, 2008, by = 3))
box()
